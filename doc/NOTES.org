* [2011-01-28 Fri] Rewrite is working, plus I thought to use a RAM disk

  This whole process is IOPS bound more than anything else, so using a RAM
  disk greatly improved speed, and reduced wear on my hard drives.

* This is going too slowly, will rewrite in C++ and using libgit2

  Here are some initial numbers after porting the Subversion dumper to C++,
  optimized for the particular use case of subconvert:

  |        |           |         <r> |       <r> |     <r> |           <r> |
  | Python |           | 81.41s user | 8.98s sys | 88% cpu | 1:42.47 total |
  | C++    | g++ -fast |  6.42s user | 2.13s sys | 99% cpu | 0:08.55 total |

  [2011-01-28 Fri]: I later found out this wasn't a fair comparison, as the
  C++ scanner was just skipping over the text regions, instead of reading
  them.  The real C++ numbers are in the 55s range.

* [2011-01-23 Sun] Initial flat conversion completed, unoptimized
